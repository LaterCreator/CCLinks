<h1>This is just a list of useful statistics for now</h1>
  
<h2>How much CO2 has already been released, how much is released a year and what are the planet's reserves?</h2>

<h2>What other greenhouse gases exist and what is their GWP? <strong>(Global Warming Potential</strong></h2>

<p>Some essential information that is neatly left out of these statistics is the time period in which the GWP of the gases is analyzed. You have probably heard before, that methane traps 25 times more heat than CO2. This isn't necessarily incorrect, but that is the amount over a 100 year time span. If we look at methanes instantenous GWP it paints a different picture, cause there it is ~120 times greater. Why do most statistics use the effects of these gases over a 100 year time span? To make them seem less impactful than they are. Why is the immediate GWP so important? Because the oceans trap heat. It is a ploy by the industries, they are all trying their very best to hide the true effects in order to make more money.</p>
