    <h1>Impacts of animal agriculture on climate change</h1>


  <h2>How are they connected?</h2>

<p>Animal agriculture is one of the main driver's of climate change, the impact of that industry on the planet's health is often downplayed, because the industry has such far reaching power and influence on every level of society, but especially politics. Here I would just like to recommend a really great documentary that helped me understand this issue much better: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaPge01NQTQ"_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eating to extinction</a></p>

<br><p>To get a grasp on the full impact of this industry on the climate there are multiple important factors to take into consideration. I highlighted Methanes instantenous GWP, because using methanes impact over a 100 year scale takes away its actual impact. The oceans store heat so the immediate impact this gas has is essential.

    <h2>If CO2 stays in the atmosphere for potentially thousands of years and we are emitting more CO2 every year, what can we do?</h2>
    <p>We need time to reduce the emissions, time to change our societies, time to adapt. This time can be gained by simply abstaining from animal products that hurt you, the planet, and most importantly the victims.</p>
    <p>
        What can you and I do about a most likely catastrophic future? Are you the kind of person that puts their trust in the people in power (politicians, large corporations, shady governmental institutions, etc.)? Or do you look at it with skepticism and desire for finding out what you can do right now to do your part in the most important social movement of human history? It is important to realize that the industry is only destroying the planet because of an accumulation of individual decisions. More comfort, faster everything, better everything, shinier everything, consume, consume, consume. It would be inconceivable to even bring up the thought of consequences because that might reduce the profit. Corporations need that number to go up, no matter the cost, no matter what.
    </p>
    <p>
        While I am on my ramble let me bring up maybe the worst corporation of all: <strong>Nestle</strong>. Here are five of the probably worst things Nestle has done:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>No.1: Causing the death of millions of infants.</li>
        <li>No.2: Child slave labor.</li>
        <li>No.3: Exploiting drought-ridden areas to make a profit (California).</li>
        <li>No.4: Plastic pollution. (Their solution to this is to burn the plastic, nothing can go wrong when you do that, am I right?).</li>
        <li>No.5: Exploiting drought-ridden areas (Pakistan) to not only make a profit, but also wasting half the water and contaminating the groundwater.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Great job, Nestle! So how is it possible that Nestle still exists and is to this day one of the biggest corporations in Europe? <strong>Manipulation :)</strong>
