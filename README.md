<h1>Impacts of animal agriculture on climate change</h1>

<h2>How much CO2 has already been released, how much is released a year and what are the planet's reserves?</h2>

<h2>What other greenhouse gases exist and what is their GWP? <strong>(Global Warming Potential</strong></h2>
<p>Methane's instantenous GWP is 120 times greater than that of CO2! Since oceans obviously store heat, it's important to remember.</p>

<h2>If CO2 stays in the atmosphere for potentially thousands of years and we are running out of time, what can we do?</h2>

<p>Now I just want to clarify that I am not a specialist, I do not know everything, well I probably know very little considering the amount of data available. But I do know one thing: <strong>We need time</strong><br>
<br>To understand how we obtain more time there are some important facts to know. Maybe you already know them, maybe you don't but here they are nonetheless<br>
